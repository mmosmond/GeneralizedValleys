  abstract =      {Epistasis for fitness means that the selective effect
                   of a mutation is conditional on the genetic
                   background in which it appears. Although epistasis is
                   widely observed in nature, our understanding of its
                   consequences for evolution by natural selection
                   remains incomplete. In particular, much attention
                   focuses only on its influence on the instantaneous
                   rate of changes in frequency of selected alleles via
                   epistatic contribution to the additive genetic
                   variance for fitness. Thus, in this framework
                   epistasis only has evolutionary importance if the
                   interacting loci are simultaneously segregating in
                   the population. However, the selective accessibility
                   of mutational trajectories to high fitness genotypes
                   may depend on the genetic background in which novel
                   mutations appear, and this effect is independent of
                   population polymorphism at other loci. Here we
                   explore this second influence of epistasis on
                   evolution by natural selection. We show that it is
                   the consequence of a particular form of epistasis,
                   which we designate sign epistasis. Sign epistasis
                   means that the sign of the fitness effect of a
                   mutation is under epistatic control; thus, such a
                   mutation is beneficial on some genetic backgrounds
                   and deleterious on others. Recent experimental
                   innovations in microbial systems now permit
                   assessment of the fitness effects of individual
                   mutations on multiple genetic backgrounds. We review
                   this literature and identify many examples of sign
                   epistasis, and we suggest that the implications of
                   these results may generalize to other organisms.
                   These theoretical and empirical considerations imply
                   that strong genetic constraint on the selective
                   accessibility of trajectories to high fitness
                   genotypes may exist and suggest specific areas of
                   investigation for future research.},

                   evolutionary processes and guidance for the study of
                   evolution. Until recently, empirical evidence on the
                   ruggedness of these landscapes was lacking, but since
                   it became feasible to construct all possible
                   genotypes containing combinations of a limited set of
                   mutations, the number of studies has grown to a point
                   where a classification of landscapes becomes
                   possible. The aim of this review is to identify
                   measures of epistasis that allow a meaningful
                   comparison of fitness landscapes and then apply them
                   to the empirical landscapes to discern factors that
                   affect ruggedness. The various measures of epistasis
                   that have been proposed in the literature appear to
                   be equivalent. Our comparison shows that the
                   ruggedness of the empirical landscape is affected by
                   whether the included mutations are beneficial or
                   deleterious and by whether intra- or intergenic
                   epistasis is involved. Finally, the empirical
                   landscapes are compared to landscapes generated with
                   the Rough Mt.\ Fuji model. Despite the simplicity of
                   this model, it captures the features of the
                   experimental landscapes remarkably well.},

                   history of evolved resistance to insecticides,
                   antibiotics, and vaccines. One experimental approach
                   focuses on studies of mutant proteins and all
                   combinations of mutant sites that could possibly be
                   intermediates in the evolutionary pathway to
                   resistance. In organisms carrying each of the
                   engineered proteins, a measure of protein function or
                   a proxy for fitness is estimated. The correspondence
                   between protein sequence and fitness is widely known
                   as a fitness landscape or adaptive landscape. Here,
                   we examine some empirical fitness landscapes and
                   compare them with simulated landscapes in which the

                   reflected in a summary statistic for adaptive
                   landscapes known as the "roughness," which for the
                   actual proteins so far examined lies in the smallest
                   0.5% tail of random landscapes.},

  abstract =      {A two-locus model is presented to analyze the
                   evolution of compensatory mutations occurring in
                   stems of RNA secondary structures. Single mutations
                   are assumed to be deleterious but harmless (neutral)
                   in appropriate combinations. In proceeding under
                   mutation pressure, natural selection and genetic
                   drift from one fitness peak to another one, a
                   population must therefore pass through a valley of
                   intermediate deleterious states of individual
                   fitness. The expected time for this transition is
                   calculated using diffusion theory. The rate of
                   compensatory evolution, kappa c, is then defined as
                   the inverse of the expected transition time. When
                   selection against deleterious single mutations is
                   strong, kappa c becomes independent on the
                   recombination fraction r between the two loci.
                   Recombination generally reduces the rate of
                   compensatory evolution because it breaks up favorable
                   combinations of double mutants. For complete linkage,
                   kappa c is given by the rate at which favorable
                   combinations of double mutants are produced by
                   compensatory mutation. For r > O, kappa c decreases
                   exponentially with r. In contrast, kappa c becomes
                   independent of r for weak selection. We discuss the
                   dynamics of evolutionary substitutions of
                   compensatory mutants in relation of WRIGHT's shifting
                   balance theory of evolution and use our results to
                   analyze the substitution process in helices of mRNA

  abstract =      {R.A. Fisher and H.J. Muller argued in the 1930s that
                   a major evolutionary advantage of recombination is
                   that it allows favorable mutations to be combined
                   within an individual even when they first appear in
                   different individuals. This effect is evaluated in a
                   two-locus, two-allele model by calculating the
                   average waiting time until a new genotypic
                   combination first appears in a haploid population.
                   Three approximations are developed and compared with
                   Monte Carlo simulations of the Wright-Fisher process
                   of random genetic drift in a finite population.
                   First, a crude method, based on the deterministic
                   accumulation of single mutants, produces a waiting
                   time of 1/square root of N mu(2) with no
                   recombination and [formula: see text] with
                   recombination between the two loci, where mu is the
                   mutation rate, N is the haploid population size, and
                   R is the recombination rate. Second, the waiting time
                   is calculated as the expected value of a
                   heterogeneous geometric distribution obtained from a
                   branching process approximation. This gives accurate
                   estimates for small values of N mu large. The
                   estimates for small values of N mu are considerably
                   lower than the simulated values. Finally, diffusion
                   analysis of the Wright-Fisher process provides
                   accurate estimates for N mu small, and the time
                   scales of the diffusion process show a difference
                   between R = 0 and for R > 0 of the same order of
                   magnitude as seen in the deterministic analysis. In
                   the absence of recombination, accurate approximations
                   to the waiting time are obtained by using the
                   branching process for high N mu and the diffusion
                   approximation for low N mu. For low N mu the waiting
                   time is well approximated by 1/the square root of 8N2
                   mu(3). With R > 0, the following dependence on N mu
                   is observed: For N mu > 1 the waiting time is
                   virtually independent of recombination and is well
                   described by the branching process approximation. For
                   N mu approximately equal to 1 the waiting time is
                   well described by a simplified diffusion
                   approximation that assumes symmetry in the
                   frequencies of single mutants. For N mu < 1 the
                   waiting time is well described by the diffusion
                   approximation allowing asymmetry in the frequencies
                   of single mutants. Recombination lowers the waiting
                   time until a new genotypic combination first appears,
                   but the effect is small compared to that of the
                   mutation rate and population size. For large N mu,
                   recombination has a negligible effect, and its effect
                   is strongest for small N mu, in which case the
                   waiting time approaches a fixed fraction of the
                   waiting time for R = 0. Free recombination lowers the
                   waiting time to about 45% of the waiting time for
                   absolute linkage for small N mu. Selection has little
                   effect on the importance of recombination in
                   general.},

                   to a better one can be divided into two steps: first
                   the advantageous combination has to appear and then
                   it has to take over the population. Selection can
                   have contrasting effects on the two stages. When
                   selection is weak intermediate forms are frequent,
                   and the advantageous combination appears easily.
                   Spreading of that advantageous combination, on the
                   other hand, tends to be hard, as recombination acts
                   to break it. The opposite is true when selection is
                   strong. Spreading is easier, but if selection is also
                   strong against the intermediate forms, the appearance
                   of the beneficial combination becomes an extremely
                   rare event. This inherent contrast in the optimal
                   conditions for the two stages raises the possibility
                   that proximity of areas differing in the intensity of

                   of this phenomenon to the problem of adaptation and
                   speciation on a rugged adaptive landscape. One
                   consequence of fitness-associated dispersal (FAD) is
                   that individuals with high fitness are more likely to
                   experience inbreeding, especially with other fit
                   individuals. Another consequence is that when
                   dispersal is costly, the less fit individuals are
                   more likely to pay the cost. When a rare and
                   advantageous allelic combination appears, FAD may
                   increase its chances to spread in the population. In
                   a two-locus two-alleles model with negative
                   epistasis, we find that FAD significantly shortens
                   the waiting time for an adaptive peak shift in
                   comparison with random dispersal.},

                   different genetic loci. This can lead to sign
                   epistasis, whereby mutations that are individually
                   deleterious or neutral combine to confer a fitness
                   benefit. In order to acquire the beneficial genotype,
                   an asexual population must cross a fitness valley or
                   plateau by first acquiring the deleterious or neutral
                   intermediates. Here, we present a complete, intuitive
                   theoretical description of the valley-crossing
                   process across the full spectrum of possible
                   parameter regimes. We calculate the rate at which a
                   population crosses a fitness valley or plateau of
                   arbitrary width, as a function of the mutation rates,
                   the population size, and the fitnesses of the
                   intermediates. We find that when intermediates are
                   close to neutral, a large population can cross even
                   wide fitness valleys remarkably quickly, so that
                   valley-crossing dynamics may be common even when
                   mutations that directly increase fitness are also
                   possible. Thus the evolutionary dynamics of large
                   populations can be sensitive to the structure of an
                   extended region of the fitness landscape - the
                   population may not take directly uphill paths in
                   favor of paths across valleys and plateaus that lead
                   eventually to fitter genotypes. In smaller
                   populations, we find that below a threshold size,
                   which depends on the width of the fitness valley and
                   the strength of selection against intermediate
                   genotypes, valley-crossing is much less likely and
                   hence the evolutionary dynamics are less influenced
                   by distant regions of the fitness landscape.},

                   between different genetic loci. This can lead to sign
                   epistasis, in which a beneficial adaptation involves
                   a combination of individually deleterious or neutral
                   mutations; in this case, a population must cross a
                   "fitness valley" to adapt. Recombination can assist
                   this process by combining mutations from different
                   individuals or retard it by breaking up the adaptive
                   combination. Here, we analyze the simplest fitness
                   valley, in which an adaptation requires one mutation
                   at each of two loci to provide a fitness benefit. We
                   present a theoretical analysis of the effect of
                   recombination on the valley-crossing process across
                   the full spectrum of possible parameter regimes. We
                   find that low recombination rates can speed up valley
                   crossing relative to the asexual case, while higher
                   recombination rates slow down valley crossing, with
                   the transition between the two regimes occurring when
                   the recombination rate between the loci is
                   approximately equal to the selective advantage
                   provided by the adaptation. In large populations, if
                   the recombination rate is high and selection against
                   single mutants is substantial, the time to cross the
                   valley grows exponentially with population size,
                   effectively meaning that the population cannot
                   acquire the adaptation. Recombination at the optimal
                   (low) rate can reduce the valley-crossing time by up
                   to several orders of magnitude relative to that in an
                   asexual population.},

                   random drift shifts a population between alternative
                   equilibria. This formula is valid when such shifts
                   are rare (Ns much greater than 1), and applies over a
                   wide range of mutation rates. When the number of
                   mutations entering the population is low (4 N mu much
                   less than 1), the rate of stochastic shifts reduces
                   to the product of the mutation rate and the
                   probability of fixation of a single mutation.
                   However, when many mutations enter the population in
                   each generation (4 N mu much greater than 1), the
                   rate is higher than would be expected if mutations
                   were established independently, and converges to that

                   selection on the process of fixation of two linked
                   loci with epistatic interactions in fitness. We
                   consider both the probability of fixation of newly
                   arising mutants (the static model) and the time to
                   fixation under continued mutation (the dynamic
                   model). Our results show that the fixation of a new
                   advantageous combination is facilitated by higher
                   fitness of the advantageous genotype and by weaker
                   selection against the intermediate deleterious
                   genotypes. Fixation occurs more rapidly when the
                   recombination rates are small, except when selection
                   against intermediate genotypes is weak and selection
                   in favour of the double mutant is very strong. In
                   these cases fixation is more rapid when the
                   recombinant rate is large. Mutations of strong
                   effects, deleterious when alone but beneficial when
                   coupled, are fixed more easily than mutations of
                   intermediate effects, at least for large
                   recombination rates. Among the possible pathways the
                   process of fixation might follow, independent
                   substitutions lead to the fixation of the double
                   mutant only when selection is weak. The relative
                   importance of the other pathways depends on the
                   interaction between recombination and selection. The
                   coupled-gamete pathway (i.e. when the population
                   waits until the double mutant appears and then drives
                   it to fixation) is more important as selection
                   intensity increases and the recombination rate is
                   reduced. For all recombination rates, asymmetries in
                   fitness of the intermediate genotypes increase the
                   rate at which fixations occur. Finally, throughout
                   the fixation process, the population will be
                   monomorphic at least at one of the two loci for most
                   of the time, which implies that there would be little
                   opportunity to detect the presence of negative
                   epistasis even if it were important for occasional
                   evolutionary transitions.},

                   a finite population with two available adaptive zones

  abstract =      {Niche construction is a process through which
                   organisms modify their environment and, as a result,
                   alter the selection pressures on themselves and other
                   species. In cultural niche construction, one or more
                   cultural traits can influence the evolution of other
                   cultural or biological traits by affecting the social
                   environment in which the latter traits may evolve.
                   Cultural niche construction may include either
                   gene-culture or culture-culture interactions. Here we
                   develop a model of this process and suggest some
                   applications of this model. We examine the
                   interactions between cultural transmission,
                   selection, and assorting, paying particular attention
                   to the complexities that arise when selection and
                   assorting are both present, in which case stable
                   polymorphisms of all cultural phenotypes are
                   possible. We compare our model to a recent model for
                   the joint evolution of religion and fertility and
                   discuss other potential applications of cultural
                   niche construction theory, including the evolution
                   and maintenance of large-scale human conflict and the
                   relationship between sex ratio bias and marriage
                   customs. The evolutionary framework we introduce
                   begins to address complexities that arise in the
                   quantitative analysis of multiple interacting
                   cultural traits.},

                   frequently occurs when a population becomes fixed for
                   one or more chromosomal rearrangements that reduce
                   fitness when they are heterozygous. This hypothesis
                   has little theoretical support because mutations that
                   cause a large reduction in fitness can be fixed
                   through drift only in small, inbred populations.
                   Moreover, the effects of chromosomal rearrangements
                   on fitness are unpredictable and vary significantly
                   between plants and animals. I argue that

                   recombination and extending the effects of linked

                   inversions affect rates of adaptation, speciation,
                   and the evolution of sex chromosomes. Comparative
                   genomic studies have identified many new paracentric
                   inversion polymorphisms. Population models suggest
                   that inversions can spread by reducing recombination
                   between alleles that independently increase fitness,
                   without epistasis or coadaptation. Areas of linkage
                   disequilibrium extend across large inversions but may
                   be interspersed by areas with little disequilibrium.
                   Genes located within inversions are associated with a
                   variety of traits including those involved in
                   climatic adaptation. Inversion polymorphisms may
                   contribute to speciation by generating underdominance
                   owing to inviable gametes, but an alternative view
                   gaining support is that inversions facilitate
                   speciation by reducing recombination, protecting
                   genomic regions from introgression. Likewise,
                   inversions may facilitate the evolution of sex
                   chromosomes by reducing recombination between sex
                   determining alleles and alleles with sex-specific
                   effects. However, few genes within inversions

                   role in speciation resulted from the observation that
                   heterokaryotypes are often infertile. However, the
                   first chromosomal speciation models were
                   unsatisfactory and data available to test them was
                   scarce. Recently, large amounts of data have become
                   available and new theoretical models have been
                   developed explaining how rearrangements facilitate
                   speciation in the face of gene flow. Here, we
                   re-examine theoretical predictions and revisit
                   different sources of data. Although rearrangements
                   are often associated with increased levels of

  abstract =      {New species may arise via hybridization and without a
                   change in ploidy. This process, termed homoploid
                   hybrid speciation, is theoretically difficult because
                   it requires the development of reproductive barriers
                   in sympatry or parapatry. Theory suggests that
                   isolation may arise through rapid karyotypic
                   evolution and/or ecological divergence of hybrid
                   neospecies. Here, we investigate the role of
                   karyotypic change in homoploid hybrid speciation by
                   generating detailed genetic linkage maps for three
                   hybrid sunflower species, Helianthus anomalus, H.
                   deserticola, and H. paradoxus, and comparing these
                   maps to those previously generated for the parental
                   species, H. annuus and H. petiolaris. We also conduct
                   a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of pollen
                   fertility in a BC2 population between the parental
                   species and assess levels of pollen and seed
                   fertility in all cross-combinations of the hybrid and
                   parental species. The three hybrid species are
                   massively divergent from their parental species in
                   karyotype; gene order differences were observed for
                   between 9 and 11 linkage groups (of 17 total),
                   depending on the comparison. About one-third of the
                   karyoypic differences arose through the sorting of
                   chromosomal rearrangements that differentiate the
                   parental species, but the remainder appear to have
                   arisen de novo (six breakages/six fusions in H.
                   anomalus, four breakages/three fusions in H.
                   deserticola, and five breakages/five fusions in H.
                   paradoxus). QTL analyses indicate that the karyotypic
                   differences contribute to reproductive isolation.
                   Nine of 11 pollen viability QTL occur on rearranged
                   chromosomes and all but one map close to a
                   rearrangement breakpoint. Finally, pollen and seed
                   fertility estimates for F1's between the hybrid and
                   parental species fall below 11%, which is sufficient
                   for evolutionary independence of the hybrid
                   neospecies.},

                   indirectly, by suppressing recombination among genic
                   incompatibilities. Because direct effects of
                   rearrangements on fertility imply fitness costs
                   during their spread, understanding the mechanism of
                   F1 hybrid sterility is integral to reconstructing the
                   role(s) of rearrangements in speciation. In hybrids
                   between monkeyflowers Mimulus cardinalis and Mimulus

                   trait loci (QTLs) for both premating barriers and
                   pollen sterility, suggesting that they may have
                   facilitated speciation in this model system. We used
                   artificial chromosome doubling and comparative
                   mapping to test whether heterozygous rearrangements
                   directly cause underdominant male sterility in M.
                   lewisii-M. cardinalis hybrids. Consistent with a
                   direct chromosomal basis for hybrid sterility,
                   synthetic tetraploid F1 s showed highly restored
                   fertility (83.4% pollen fertility) relative to
                   diploids F1 s (36.0%). Additional mapping with
                   Mimulus parishii-M. cardinalis and M. parishii-M.
                   lewisii hybrids demonstrated that underdominant male
                   sterility is caused by one M. lewisii specific and
                   one M. cardinalis specific reciprocal translocation,
                   but that inversions had no direct effects on
                   fertility. We discuss the importance of
                   translocations as causes of reproductive isolation,
                   and consider models for how underdominant

                   adaption works and how it is coupled to cultural
                   transmission. Cultural group selection is of
                   particular interest in this context because it
                   depends on the same kinds of mechanisms that lead to

                   multiple equilibria are a common phenomena, and why

                   the mean fitness of individuals in it. The present
                   models show that interdeme selection during the
                   spread of a mutation depends more on the capacity of
                   the mutant to invade and become established in other
                   demes than on selective diffusion, unless there is
                   rapid local extinction and colonization. The
                   intensity of interdeme selection is reduced by random
                   local extinction and colonization, and when these
                   processes are rapid (with no selective diffusion) the
                   expected fixation rate of spontaneous mutations with
                   a heterozygote disadvantage approaches that in a
                   single isolated deme. Local extinction and
                   colonization, and selection on the homozygotes,
                   accelerate the spread of chromosomal mutations which
                   are destined to be fixed.},

  abstract =      {Humans and their closest evolutionary relatives, the
                   chimpanzees, differ in approximately 1.24% of their
                   genomic DNA sequences. The fraction of these changes
                   accumulated during the speciation processes that have
                   separated the two lineages may be of special
                   relevance in understanding the basis of their
                   differences. We analyzed human and chimpanzee
                   sequence data to search for the patterns of
                   divergence and polymorphism predicted by a
                   theoretical model of speciation. According to the
                   model, positively selected changes should accumulate
                   in chromosomes that present fixed structural
                   differences, such as inversions, between the two
                   species. Protein evolution was more than 2.2 times
                   faster in chromosomes that had undergone structural
                   rearrangements compared with colinear chromosomes.
                   Also, nucleotide variability is slightly lower in
                   rearranged chromosomes. These patterns of divergence
                   and polymorphism may be, at least in part, the
                   molecular footprint of speciation events in the human
                   and chimpanzee lineages.},
